## Topics Ideas for my Foam Flinging Blaster

Here are some areas of interest...

| Topic | Description and Questions | Relation to Physics |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| *Kinematics of Darts* | Analyze and calculate how a dart is shot until it hits a target or ground. What are the forces involved when a dart is being propelled? What are areas of improvement compared to on-the-shelf Dart Blasters (made by Nerf, etc...) | Kinematics |
| *Methods of propulsion* | What are different ways a dart could be accelerated... Flywheels, Air (springs, elastics) | Kinematics, Conservation of Energy |
| *Pain of Darts...* | Why do darts hurt when you are shot. What are the forces involved and how are different darts affected differently? How could a dart be made more **painful**?!?... shape? speed? weight? | Forces |
| *Types of Darts* | A comparison of different dart types... such as short ones, long ones, ones with different shapes, ones with different weights (and weight distribution) | Air resistance, Forces... Conservation of Energy |
| *Barrel Properties* | Length, Material, Diameter... How does the barrel length affect the velocity of the darts and accuracy? | Kinematics, Friction, Aerodynamics??? |
| *Riffling and "SCAR" attachments* | How does riffling a barrel or "SCAR" attachments which attempt to rotate the darts affect the accuracy and velocity of the darts? | Something with Aerodynamics and with CG/Center-of-pressure... |
| *Loudness of Firing* | Analyse the sources of sound when a dart is shot, most importantly on the sound of the escaping gasses | Sound, Something with Air?? |

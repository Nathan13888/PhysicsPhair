Here are my thoughts for my Personal Pandemic Physics Project Phair (5 **P**s??) thing...

---

## Requirements

As a regular *side-project pursuer*, I find it most important to establish project requirements ahead of time. For this project, I've determined several requirements:

***Practical***: The project should be reasonably possible to make. Rather than pursueing a project that is likely not going to see daylight by the end, I would rather pursue something that is reasonably difficult but is possible to make. It should also not be something that's too simple to make as there would be not enough *challenge* in that.

***Interest***: This must be a project that I find meaningful and interesting to myself. Since the options are open, might as well do something that could be used for more than one purpose, such as something that I've always been intending to do.

***Safety***: Perhaps this goes without saying, but my choice of interest should be safe and not be a personal or health risk to myself or those around me. Although things like *fire, explosives and electricity* sound fun, it might not fair too well in the hands of a *maniac*. Also besides dramatic effect, there doesn't seem to be much more physics in relatively unsafe experiments compared to safe experiments.

## TLDR; My favourite idea...

I've always had a keen interest in things that **move**; whether they are cars, robots, drones, etc. Some thing that I've always played as a child was NERF... whether it's their dart blasters or water guns. However, I've always found NERF guns to be rather *weak*. It only seems correct that children could inflict ~~emotional~~**physical** PAIN on their parents or friends to *have fun*. Nerf guns are meant to be ***"safe"*** and not cause permanant injuries, just *pain* but not too much. But as a rebelious teenager, I cannot rely on a **weak** NERF "blaster" that can't deter someone from coming nearby (*physical distancing... thank you*)!

Hence, I have devised plan to apply my **knowledge of PHYSICS** to share *pain* through PHYSICS! A **high-powered __foam slinger__** that could reach distances over 10 meters accurately is in order!

Often, off-the-shelf Nerf blasters are *"nerfed"* so that the darts would not travel too fast. Hence, Nerf blasters in their stock form are actually capable of greater performances but are only limited by purposefully designed *restrictions*, so simply modding a NERF blaster could increase the speed of its projectiles substancially.


However, **that would be too simple**!!! Applying modern technology I could create a **one-of-a-kind** creation that trumps all Nerf blasters and spread ~~fear~~physics through ***foam***.

## Some Other Ideas...

**Taser**: Sounds ***dangerous***?!??! It probably is...

**Escooter**: I've meant to build one for a while, but copper prices and everything has sky rocketted in the past year... Wouldn't it be easier to *buy* one instead, but that won't be fun...

**Superconductors**: something that could possibly experience nearly no resistance and has many real-world applications... But there seems to be too few realistic experiments I could do with it. Also it doesn't do much outside a lab...

**Cooking with lasers**: *How did I even think of this...*

**Radar**: Looks like I'm not going to be able to make this, nevermind it's efficacy...

**Solar Oven**: *did this already in Gr 5... (and failed)*

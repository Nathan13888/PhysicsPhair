## Primary Research

Hmmm so what to do... In order to test the physics of **Foam Dart Blasters** I must create a contraption that could scientifically and consistently test varying properties of a design. To reduce the number of variables in my contraption, I must make this test setup as simple as possible.

By quantitatively or qualitatively analyzing the different aspects of foam dart blasters such as the types of projectiles, darts and propolsion methods I could analytically determine and optimize my custom 3d-printed nerf dart blaster.

Namely I am looking to test and customize the following properties of a nerf blaster:
1. **Propulsion System**: there are a number of different types a dart could be propelled
2. **Attachments**: a SCAR attachment could cause the dart to rotate, improving the precision at the cost of reduced muzzle velocity
3. **Darts**: how do different types of darts affect the accuracy/precision and velocity of the projectile

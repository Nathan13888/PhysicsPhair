__***From Om:***__
> I think your plan for the PPP is very detailed and precise. You could try looking into the plunger system to better understand how NERF guns work. Additionally, you could study Bernoulli's Principle to see how the velocity and pressure that NERF darts are fired at affects their speed. Also consider why NERF guns might use air pressure instead of a spring system. I think you should be more specific about how you are going to isolate the variables in your experiment - what kind of contraption do you intend to create?

### 1) Describe ideas that you had before that you will pursue further
As Om mentioned, my plan is "detailed and precise" and talks thoroughly about my plans of testing specific properties of a foam dart blaster through a custom-made contraption (update post coming soon!!!) This contraption will allow me to test out my hypotheses and confirm trends and properties from my secondary research. Furthermore, I will be making a highly-customizable 3D-printed dart blaster where I will be applying my primary and secondary research findings to make an all-rounded dart blaster that is fun and effective (for whatever it's used for)!

### 2) Describe ideas from peer feedback that you didn't consider before
One thing that Om mentioned is Brenoulli's Principle which will affect the motion of the fired darts. I think it would be an interesting concept to consider in my primary research as this could greatly affect the accuracy and performance of the darts. However, I am worried about whether it will fit in nicely with my other *existing* research and my current plans. Nevertheless, I will definitely check it out!

### 3) Describe what changes you are making (if any) based on the peer feedback
I am planning on focusing on making a well-operating and functional contraption used to test isolated properties to improve the design of my final 3D-printed dart blaster. As I've written in my topic selection slide before, I will be focusing on a number of variables including properties of the darts, projection method and blaster barrel. I want to further focus on this contraction as Om suggested as it will allow me to more accurately identify trends in my experiments.
